It allows the cells to sense light direction and intensity and respond to it by swimming either towards the light (positive phototaxis) or away from the light (negative phototaxis). A related response (""photoshock"" or photophobic response) occurs when cells are briefly exposed to high light intensity, causing the cell to stop, briefly swim backwards, then change swimming direction. Eyespot-mediated light perception helps the cells in finding an environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Eyespots are the simplest and most common ""eyes"" found in nature, composed of photoreceptors and areas of bright orange-red pigment granules. Signals relayed from the eyespot photoreceptors result in alteration of the beating pattern of the flagella, generating a phototactic response.","2016-05-30","2017-01-20 09:01:43","2017-01-20 09:01:43","2017-01-17 11:47:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","","","","Wikipedia","","Page Version ID: 722796403","","/home/licencefdv/.mozilla/firefox/zp9bb5vi.default/zotero/storage/QUP5VNEI/index.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The instrument consists of a camera with a macro lens, a dark chamber, a light source and a laptop computer. Four nauplii were inserted into a macro cuvette, which contained copper, cadmium, iron and zinc ions at various concentrations. The nauplii were then filmed inside the dark chamber for two minutes and the video sequence was processed by a motion tracking algorithm that estimated their mobility. The results obtained by this system were compared to the mortality assay of the Artemia salina nauplii. Despite the small number of tested organisms, this system demonstrates great sensitivity in quantifying the mobility of the nauplii, which leads to significantly lower EC50 values than those of the mortality assay. Furthermore, concentrations of parts per trillion of toxic compounds could be detected for some of the metals. The main novelty of this instrument relies in the sub-pixel accuracy of the tracking algorithm that enables robust measurement of the deterioration of the mobility of Artemia salina even at very low concentrations of toxic metals.","2011-03-28","2017-01-20 09:01:43","2017-01-20 09:01:43","","36-45","","2","1","","Biosensors (Basel)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25586826 PMCID: PMC4264340","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586826","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the higher level (about 3 × 1014 quanta s−1 cm−2), the spectral response was bimodal with peaks near 560 and 700 THz frequency (about 535 and 430 nm wavelength, respectively), with an antimode at about 640 THz (465 nm). Response at the lower level (about 2 × 1014) was slightly lower and the midspectrum peak was shifted to higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) and depressed relative to the high-frequency peak near 700 THz. The results suggest that positive phototaxis is mediated by two visual pigments, the high-frequency (short-wavelength) pigment being activated at lower illuminations than the midspectrum pigment. A similar bimodal response is known from a crab larva, but this appears to be the first anostracan crustacean to have been tested., L'anostracé Artemia salina réagit positivement en présence de deux séries de lumières monochromes d'intensités quantiques à peu prées égales : deux niveaux absolus de lumière ont été utilisés. Au niveau le plus élevé (environ 3 × 1014 quanta s−1 cm−2), la réaction spectrale est bimodale, l'un des sommets se produisant à 560 THz de fréquence, l'autre à 700 THz (les longueurs d'ondes respectives étant d'environ 535 et 430 nm); il y a un antimode à environ 640 THz (465 nm). La réaction au niveau inférieur (environ 2 × 1014) est légèrement plus faible et le sommet du milieu du spectre est déplacé vers des fréquences plus élevées (longueurs d'ondes plus courtes) et plus bas que le sommet de haute fréquence enregistré près de 700 THz. Les résultats permettent de croire que laphototaxie se fait grâce à deux pigments visuels, le pigment qui réagit à haute fréquence (ondes courtes) étant activé par des éclairements plus faibles que le pigment qui réagit à des fréquences moyennes.
