This is a project about Euglena, magnetometer and magnetic fields. After reading a paper depicting a specific behavior of Euglena under an oscillating electromagnetic field (Euglena are positionning themselves parallel or perpendicular to the field lines), we wanted to know how precisely they can sense the magnetic field lines.
For that, we came up with the project Pelforce&Wine where we compared the precision of Euglena to sense magnetic field to the precision of an electronic sensor, a magnetometer (the MPU-9250).
Look for more if you want to know what came out of this experiment !
