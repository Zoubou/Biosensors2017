	abstract = {2 studies examined the organization of color perception in a total of 165 4-mo-old infants. In Study 1, Ss looked at selected spectral stimuli repeatedly until their visual attention waned. The stimuli represented instances of basic adult hue categories (blue, green, yellow, and red). Following habituation, Ss were shown a series of wavelengths which were the same as or different from the stimuli first seen. Analyses of infant attention indicate that infants categorize wavelengths by perceptual similarity (i.e., they see hues in the spectrum much as adults do). In Study 2, infants who looked at the alteration of 2 wavelengths from the same hue category habituated as did Ss who looked at the repetition of a single wavelength from that category, but Ss who looked at 2 wavelengths from different categories habituated at a slower rate. Data suggest a high degree of organization of the color world prior to language acquisition. (11/2 p ref)},

	abstract = {People perceive colors categorically. But what is the role of the environment (or nurture)—specifically, language—in color perception? The effects of language on the way people categorize and perceive colors have been considered to be minimal, but recent evidence suggests that language may indeed change color perception. Speakers of languages with different color-name repertoires show differences in the way they perceive color. Research shows that categorical effects on color perception can be induced through laboratory training and suggests language can similarly change color perception through the mechanism of perceptual learning.},
