This repository contains the project of the biosensors Team Bi Lumni. (@SimoonFR, @FdvJulie, @CaporalClement)

We've been working during one week on comparing Biosensors and mechanical sensors.
We decided to compare chloroplaste in Egeria densa reaction to light and cell photoresistor and arduino device.

In code you can follow our plot we used to analyse our Data. It is in python.
In Data you can find the rough data we get from the arduino device and the analyzing of the images.
In LabNoteBook you can follow the time line of our research.
In Presentation you will find all the information you need to understand quickly our research. (power point and poster)
